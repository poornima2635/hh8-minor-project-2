# Phishing Email Detection System
## Project Description

This project is developed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship (Minor Project–2).
The objective of this project is to detect phishing emails by analyzing email content for common phishing indicators such as suspicious keywords, malicious links, and abnormal patterns.

Phishing is a common social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or banking details. This project demonstrates a basic rule-based phishing detection approach using Python.
